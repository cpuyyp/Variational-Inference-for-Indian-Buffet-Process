# Variational-Inference-for-Indian-Buffet-Process

My derivation and code for a generalized version of VI-IBP. I extend [Doshi's model](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v5/doshi09a.html) to also infer the hyperparameters, such as, $\sigma_n$, $\sigma_A$, and $\alpha$. Users no need to worry about inaccurate parameters will lead to a bad performance.
